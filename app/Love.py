not allow the Number One to act or admit to being romantic. 
Self-restraint is strong, and the Number One may appear cold 
and distant. Even though it loves deeply it expects to be the 
head of the family.""",

2:"""You are a sweet, gentle, and considerate 
lover, sometimes giving too much for fear of offending or not 
pleasing the loved one. It is very dependent upon the encouragement and appreciation of its loved one and is easily hurt by 
criticism, sometimes showing temper-speaking bluntly when 
hurt or not happy. It is companionable and never happy alone. 
It needs love.""",

calm, reserved, and even cold manner allows.""",
