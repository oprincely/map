taken care of and to be well done. A good disposition is part of 
the progress of the period. There is much help through others, 
social activity, trips, pleasure and popularity. A feeling of subordination should be avoided,

apt to be a learning period in the affairs, causing a crisis - a sudden break in association, coming as a shock to the emotions.
It represents a needed awakening to the desires of others 
in partnerships and domestic affairs. ""","""It may disrupt old ties 
and for the time being can be very disturbing, causing delays 
and misunderstandings, feelings of loss, and separations. It is 
a period of subordination unless there is willingness to cooperate and share, even when at the head of undertakings. There

an awakening of worthwhile importance."""],

thought, to turn aside from objective interests for the time being.
""","""It is a time to plan for better emotional and mental control 
of the thoughts and actions and to try to understand what life 
is all about. The number 7 is the thinker and the seeker and demands this way of living when it appears as an Essence.
It is a time to "delve" into the occult and higher sciences and their 
principles and laws—to study them, to use them, to write 
about them, and to make them a means of progress and advancement in business and in all associations.
""","""Strange occurrences, unusual circumstances and happenings may force a new 
look at what life is. Psychic experience may bring awakenings. 
Research and scientific investigation can bring business improvement or a new career. Literary and educational pursuits

living to another in an economic manner, the 7 Essence brings 
a transition also through interests and activities never thought 
of before, with help in the end or at just the right time. ""","""There 
is a mental test to take; there can be loss and separation, but 
these orce the thoughts and interests in a new direction. Depression, limitation and separation, with the feeling of being 
alone, are to be put aside through faith and realization. The 
number 7 is the number of attraction and seeks to reward, in 
quiet ways, when poise and inner tranquility are maintained. 
Health matters should be taken care of. Marriage may be delayed or troubled. However, marriage can take place when the 
interests are on the same level of thinking."""],

E - Occurs in names many times. When it appears on a 
Table of Events it represents all that is stated above. It is a 
five-year period of experience with constantly changing conditions, repeated opportunity, exciting circumstances, the opening 
of new lines of endeavor, the urging of the individual to accept 
changes, public activity, and to keep up-to-date. Problems of 
the unexpected are apt to happen. ""","""Many experiences and 
problems are due to haste and impulse. It is wise not to quarrel 
with business associates, neighbors, or loved ones, for this can 
lead to separations, quarrels, or legal troubles. The affairs of 
the government and law enter into the experiences and are not 
to be disregarded. A strong desire for freedom may bring 
breaks in association. ""","""Freedom should not be considered a 
chance to break all ruies and regulations. Resourcefulness will 
overcome many difficulties. It is a time to move forward to 
renew and renovate the activities at home or in business. Public 
contact will bring fun, travel, interest, and help to promote bus¬ 
iness. Marriage is slightly uncertain when freedom is taken 
carelessly. ""","""Sudden marriages or separations may bring legal 
matters. Good for all lines of work which need the support of 
the people. Money today, not as much tomorrow, but there

considered. This may be slightly unsettled with some unhappi¬

W - Calls for the same progressive spirit as the E and N. It

even the feeling of shock, but are necessary for the individual’s 
growth to break up old conditions. This is to quicken the individual’s efforts, to prevent slowing down or becoming fixed 
in ideas and ways of living. Life must move forward. There is 
something to be dug out of the consciousness to prevent self-satisfaction or egotism. ""","""
Business may call for travel or being 
away from home: Mining interest, underground activities as oil 
or natural products. Real estate gives opportunity, also transportation or travel.
Take good care of the health. Avoid nervousness or resentments toward others. Take care of legal 
activities with good counsel. Get a grip on things and seize the 
opportunity the "break up" brought about. Depression or 
self-pity gains very little. After many ups and downs a way to 
cross over opens up.

The practical and physical care of the home, family, 
children, and domestic responsibility are the concern under tne 
F period, but may bring restrictions to some degree, even 
though service is willingly given. The F period, even though 
one of responsibility to others, seeks to lift one out of the 
seeming difficulties when the period is over. Time is needed to 
accomplish the tasks, as F is a six-year period oi growth and 
development. ""","""The right method, the right emotional attitude 
towards others must be gained. In this way, financial affairs 
are built up and the character developed. When the duty is 
taken as a privilege and not as a burden, the position and success of the undertakings will be promoted.
Loved ones, members of the family and children, even adoptions or separation 
in marriage bring peculiar circumstance. The good of the children is important and a clue to happier relationships.
Loss may be taken if there is too much emotion expressed of a selfish nature.
Through interest and service to the community, financial 
gain will be made with social standing. ""","""Association with big 
firms, industry carried out on a broad scale, produce, farms, 
and the many artistic services give business opportunity. Do 
not take on too much duty. Do not drudge. Serve willingly. 
Have more faith in yourself and what you are doing, and appreciate the tasks you are carrying out.
Health, when disturbed, will be improved through less worry about little things. 
Keep an interest in charity. Support welfare endeavors. A plan

Affairs connected with financial improvement concern the O; banking, trust funds, legal activities,
and old established business; medicine, teaching, music, artistic professions, 
and professional sciences. There are many duties; and much 
work to do regarding the home, family, and children, but with 
less physical care than under the F period. Financial gain and 
general improvement follow the willingness to accept these responsibilities. ""","""The O period offers the opportunity to settle 
down, establish a business, and enjoy the ideals of the home, 
garden, estate, and the luxuries accompanying the service given 
in the community. The love of home and family is strong. 
There are decisions to be made regarding children, often connected with trust funds and inheritances. There is little gain 
through disagreement and discord. Harmony, beauty, quiet association are needed for wise judgment. Disharmony, loud and 
unlovely environment can cause illness and much unhappiness 
in the affairs of love and marriage, resulting in doctor bills, 
health problems, and much expense. ""","""There is recovery when 
more love is expressed. Dominance is not a good rule. The true 
desire to help others brings a finer reward. Religious and artistic associations bring pleasure. It is not a good time to lend or 
borrow money unless security is established. Friends, clubs, and 
good fellowship at home and in business are enjoyable experiences during the O period. Good for investments, but not 
speculation.

action is the privilege of each member of the family. To seek to 
possess and hold may bring regret. A great loyalty exists between children and family, and when there is need of assistance 
this will be given. ""","""Financial progress is good through lines of 
business which serve the public and supply goods and materials 
for everyday needs. (The letter X is found on many commercial 
products.) There may be a sacrifice made for the sake of others,

health if the emotions are too dominant and not for the good

thought and feeling, touched with spiritual and religious purpose or the ideal of service for humanity. ""","""In this way, personal 
rewards are received plus the good things life has to offer. Discord and argument gain very little.
Schools, education, music, entertainment, radio, television, commercial art, hospitals, and
