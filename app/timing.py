quiet ways, when poise and inner tranquility are maintained.

E - Occurs in names many times. When it appears on a

five-year period of experience with constantly changing conditions, repeated opportunity, exciting circumstances, the opening

breaks in association. ""","""Freedom should not be considered a

Business may call for travel or being

opportunity the "break up" brought about. Depression or

The practical and physical care of the home, family,

one of responsibility to others, seeks to lift one out of the

accomplish the tasks, as F is a six-year period oi growth and 
development. ""","""The right method, the right emotional attitude 
towards others must be gained. In this way, financial affairs

taken as a privilege and not as a burden, the position and success of the undertakings will be promoted.
Loved ones, members of the family and children, even adoptions or separation

Affairs connected with financial improvement concern the O; banking, trust funds, legal activities,

work to do regarding the home, family, and children, but with 
less physical care than under the F period. Financial gain and 
general improvement follow the willingness to accept these responsibilities. ""","""The O period offers the opportunity to settle 
down, establish a business, and enjoy the ideals of the home, 
garden, estate, and the luxuries accompanying the service given 
in the community. The love of home and family is strong. 
There are decisions to be made regarding children, often connected with trust funds and inheritances. There is little gain 
through disagreement and discord. Harmony, beauty, quiet association are needed for wise judgment. Disharmony, loud and 
unlovely environment can cause illness and much unhappiness 
in the affairs of love and marriage, resulting in doctor bills, 
health problems, and much expense. ""","""There is recovery when 
more love is expressed. Dominance is not a good rule. The true 
desire to help others brings a finer reward. Religious and artistic associations bring pleasure. It is not a good time to lend or 
borrow money unless security is established. Friends, clubs, and 
good fellowship at home and in business are enjoyable experiences during the O period. Good for investments, but not 
speculation.

"new" cycle of experiences, and the next nine years of your

time to have courage, to make plans, and to avoid inertia or indecision. You must look to the future and be willing to change 
and advance for the sake of progress and happiness, it may be 
necessary for you to let go of things having to do with the past 
in order to take advantage of new opportunities, so be determined. Do not drift or have fear of the future, for if you do 
you may lose out during a "beginning" time, such as you are 
experiencing, because in standing still or looking back you are 
caught in the ebb tide of opportunity, missing the opportunity 
which is present but which must be seized. 

This is not an easy year and you will need to use a great 
deal of system and organization to get the desired results. This 
year calls for strength of purpose and clear thinking, but it has 
an opportunity hidden in its movement if you are alert enough 
to recognize it. Try to broaden your activities and in meeting 
conditions or circumstances which come up unexpectedly, call 
upon your executive ability and originality of thought. Life is 
now testing your character and your courage. You must show 
what you have and what you can do. 

Study your plans and your surroundings and do not be 
afraid to take a chance with a new idea or plan, but avoid being impulsive or headstrong in making changes or moving forward.
You are at the crossroads and wisdom is needed to get 
on the right track. It is up to you to do the thinking and planning for yourself and others.
You may not fully realize this until the Fall of the year, even though several times during the 
Spring and Summer you will be called upon to make vital decisions concerning your future and what you want out of life. 

During the Spring and Summer take care of your health 
and that of loved ones. In fact, make an effort to direct all 
conditions of your life towards a more constructive expression. 
In April there is a break and a chance to move ahead. Take 
some action now for improvement. In May, rest and have 
poise; say very little. August and September, according to your 
Year Number, bring many things to a head, and the Fall can 
open the way to new opportunities and decisions you may not 
have counted upon. Keep moving forward all during the year 
for you may be able to work out your plans earlier than anticipated.
December is a practical month—carries a practical number.
Be very wise now and get down to work in a concrete manner, upon your former plans.

The colors this year to help you “win” are Rame, Copper, Lilac, and Crimson."""],
