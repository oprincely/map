'average_9s':["""
Average Nines - This is the number of the brotherhood of 
man and is found three or four times in most names. Without 
this influence, mankind would have destroyed itsel long ago. 
The number nine gives compassion, tolerance, benevolence, 
and goodwill towards mankind, and it is because of this number that all races, religions, and all peoples live in the world together, even with difference of opinions and traditions. Number 
nine gives the color and drama to life and the ability to understand all levels of living. It is impressionable, intuitive, has 
deep eeling with appreciation of the grandeur of life—qualities belonging to all people. """],

'many_9s':["""
Many Nines - Give impressionability, imagination, and 
generosity, often to an extreme, and lack of direction and 
balance of feeling, thought, and action; a tendency to follow 
dreams and impressions without practical direction or without 
emotional balance, with little actual accomplishment, but adding beauty, warmth, and inspiration to others. The individual 
with many nines will not be easy to reason with, but is often 
forgiven because of the generosity that is in the nature. Six or 
seven nines can give so much feeling that the character may be 
overly sensitive, moody, and not too well physically, but have 
flashes of intuition and wisdom to accomplish, without reason 
or so-called common sense. Great religionists, noted dramatists 
sometimes have many nines in their names. One should avoid 
habits of food and drink under periods of disappointment."""],

'no_9s':["""
No Nines - This is sometimes found in names, but is not 
common. Nine is an outstanding characteristic, and, if this is 
not made up or balanced by nines somewhere on the major positions, it can be an indication of lack of broadness, tolerance, 
and compassion in the nature, even though sixes may be present. The number six is the humanitarian number and renders 
service to others. On the other hand, the number nine is the 
philanthropist, giving without thought of return. No nines indicates a nature that is helpful, kind, and capable, but without 
the feeling of universal forgiveness or giving which characterizes the number nine. A lack of nines may limit the extent of 
the accomplishments. Studies of comparative religions and 
character analysis will be helpful."""],
