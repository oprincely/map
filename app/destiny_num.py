strong sense of what is right, and even though you are strong in 
your likes and dislikes, you have a natural friendliness, combined 
with a sense of dignity and self-importance. 
""","""
You like to feel sure, to have a nest egg, and have a very good sense of 
practical values which, if you cultivate it, will help you in the 
business world. You like to have a plan and are patient about 
the details when you can take time to work them out accurately 
and carefully. There is a fine ability too, in your make-up, to 
manage, systematize, and to establish order and routine. You 
like to have things done well and can be exacting about the details 
of personal items, sometimes neglecting the bigger things 
for the smaller details, even in business. 
""","""
You are approachable in personality and in business are 
capable of helping everyone. At the same time you are rather 
selective in your personal friendships and associations. You are 
naturally careful with your possessions, competent, and a good 
manager, and have the ability to inspire confidence, for you 
are noT easily carried away by fancies or fads and extravagant 
undertakings. You like the best in life, and are a good spender, 
but you can be very careful about money and demand return 
for value given.

You are capable o working hard and show tenacity and perseverance when your mind is made up; and a few 
hard knocks are good for you as they bring out your natural courage, powers of concentration, honesty, and your good nature. 
You seem to do better when you have a hard problem 
than when things are too easy. Now and then you can be a little 
exacting, even a little bossy and dominant, and like to give 
orders rather than take them; and you may argue or be a little 
bit contrary when you do not have your own way; so watch out 
for this as it can make difficulties for you.

But value your fine powers oF management and of constructive endeavor, and 
these will take you far in the business world.

You are the executive type and have splendid powers of 
organization, placing you among those who organize, coach, 
supervise, direct, and govern affairs, at home and out in the

energetic, efficient, and capable of judging people and 
situations with a air mind. 
""","""
These talents should give you authority, recognition, 
position and power in the social, professional 
and business world. You have a natural ability to judge 
character, a philosophical turn of mind, and wonderful powers 
of self-control; you have the courage and energy to repeat your 
e: forts until you reach your goal. You should be at the head of 
large undertakings and business and professional activities, for 
a small, narrow, routine life does not bring out your strength 
and efficiency. 
""","""
In fact, an emergency or need does much to 
bring out your real character and force of initiative. Your success 
in life comes from working for a goal or purpose through 
organizing work, endeavor, and plans helpful to many people. 
You are not exactly the humanitarian, but you do have the 
ability to inspire others to greater effort and to do things for 
yourself and the world in a spectacular and valuable manner. 
""","""
There is a very fine side to your character, capable of mastering 
the hardest problems, through a faith in spiritual and 
philosophical law. Another side is often commercial, material 
in thought and interested only in financial gain. Your best success 
comes, however, as you strike a balance between these 
two, to give you the wise judgment which Life demands of 
you. 
""","""
Sometimes you strain, strive, think too much of money, 
and use so much energy doing things that you wear yourself 
out, driving love and business away instead of attracting them. 
Don’t strive so hard. Just make sure your judgment is good 
and take time to do things well; then your natural executive 
ability will take you to the top. This judgment is the keynote to 
your position and authority and should place you at the head 
of business and broad professional enterprise.

You are naturally selective and discriminating, for deep in 
your heart there is a desire for the best life has to offer. A keen 
sense of perfection governs your life and all your undertakings. 
You aim high and strive for the perfect result. You should 
never lose sight of your ideals but sometimes you reach for a 
goal that is almost unattainable, thus making it difficult for 
others to understand you or to live up to your expectations of 
them. Your sense of the "fitness of things" is tremendously 
strong and you derive your greatest satisfaction from being 
sure everything is just right.""",
""" You do not regard any effort to be 
accurate and certain as a loss of time. You greatly desire knowledge and
want to know the reason why. You are not a person 
to accept things at their surface value, but seek to prove, test, 
and understand the motives, causes, and underlying principles 
before you accept them or make them a part of your life. Your 
ideals are well defined and, if possible, you refuse to accept 
anything-friendship, opportunity, or environment - if it does 
not measure up to your standards.""","""

You have a deep intuitive feeling, and even though you 
may seem to be analytical and mental, you sense and feel hidden
values, higher principles, spiritual and occult standards 
with which to measure life. You should accept them and use 
them in your everyday affairs. If you do they will make you 
outstanding, if not to the world, at least in your circle of activity,
enabling you to uncover and develop the hidden laws of 
life for the improvement of humanity. Your desire for the best 
makes you particular about your associations. You are often 
very quiet in manner and have a great deal of pride.""","""
From time 
to time you experience the desire to get away from the jazz and 
excitement of the world, to live a life of solitude and serenity 
on mental horizons. No matter how active your life is, you 
should daily make it a practice to take time out to rest, relax 
and to be alone, to think, study and meditate, especially when 
you have a serious problem to meet. By so doing you will make 
fewer mistakes and discover your inner soul guidance.""","""
Your natural reserve may cause people to consider you 
distant, proud and hard to meet. Your faculty of analysis may 
make you appear cool, calculating and suspicious. So be careful
of your actions and allow others to discover the really generous spirit you have hidden beneath a seemingly cool manner, 
especially in love and marriage. You can be exacting and demand
explanations from others which may bring about misunderstanding and separation. When others misunderstand you, 
conscientiously seek to overcome the misunderstanding. At 
heart, you are really a visionary person and you love the odd, 
the mysterious and the unusual. ""","""Keep a broad faith in life itself 
and in people, but do not permit your quiet, reserved nature to 
suppress you. Go forth with dignity and pride, but be kind and 
forgiving and value your urge to get the best out of life. Let he 
charm and distinction and cleverness which you inherently possess lift you to a specialized and outstanding position in life. 
When you realize your desires, be sure to share with others, if 
you want to find true happiness.""","""
