pinnacle = {
2:["""This is the number of partnerships, associations, and 
unions. It brings many people into the work or undertaking, 
and involvement in the affairs of others at home or in business. 
It is not a period of independence, for the best results are 
through harmonious relationship with others. ""","""The test of the 
period is in the ability to get on with others and to work with 
them without getting involved beyond the need brought about 
through the necessary associations. Sometimes the individual, 
moving into a two Pinnacle, has to learn patience, cooperation, sharing, and consideration of others.
During a first Pinnacle, a young person may seem unduly sensitive and unable to 
take hold of things. ""","""Nothing is gained by running away from 
any situation; and parents may need to establish right associations, give a good education,
make a careful study of the talents and abilities, and help the young person understand life, 
people, and himself. To force a child, or to fail to understand 
the sensitive forces operating at the time, is to bring about 
complexes, extreme sensitiveness, or just the opposite-fool-hardy aggressiveness. ""","""All twos on the Pinnacles work best in 
association with many people, the moving public and cultural 
considerations. There is often statistical ability, a feeling for 
details and finished fine work, patient, careful accuracy and 
precision. This holds true throughout the two Pinnacles, for 
the best results are by friendly and interested cooperation in 
work. Difficulties in partnerships, associations, and friendships may come about. ""","""Personal hurts through others, divorce 
and separations are the tests to be taken unless the true spirit of 
cooperation is cultivated. The individual under the two Pinnacle must also be careful not to hurt others and to be fair in all 
dealings."""],
11:["""When the (11) 2 Pinnacle is the indication for any period, there can be a breaking of an association in a surprising 
way and a lesson to be learned in spiritual thinking and faith. 
Even men, through the hurts received in partnerships or in love 
and marriage, turn to religion, philosophical and spiritual 
thinking and study. What seems to be a big change in the life is 
almost always good in the end, for it brings the character to 
deeper understanding of the self and of the rights of others. 
Rewards come through fine technical or unusual lines of activity or production."""],
3:["""This is the number of inspiration, creative ability, and artistic feeling and opens the door for more personal expression 
on any Pinnacle. It is an easy Pinnacle in that the work or 
undertakings are not physical, but deal with imagination and 
feeling. It gives opportunity through writing, speaking, the theater, designing, illustration, or for origination
of ideas of a creative nature. This may be in business as well as the artistic 
fields. ""","""It is a time of pouring out the feelings and allows for 
general enjoyment of the pleasures of life, as it carries a natural attraction for money and the easier phases of living. When 
it is found on the first Pinnacle there is always an artistic opportunity present, but, very often, a young person shows little 
tendency for hard work and seeks to enjoy life without too 
much practical effort. The first Pinnacle can be wasted, causing regret later on, if an effort is not made to direct the talents 
while the time is at hand. ""","""Education along creative lines should 
be given even if not ultimately chosen as a career. Under the 
second or third Pinnacle it can be a blessing, giving more personal opportunity to develop the talents and personal ideas 
than at any other time. However, extravagant and careless expression of the emotions and feelings can lead to so
many unhappy experiences that others may be called on to help the 
individual out of trouble. The eternal triangle often appears, 
and friends, while helpful, can be misleading; money can be 
lost through the influence of good talkers and those who appeal to the emotional nature. ""","""Even on the last Pinnacle,
control over the emotions is necessary to keep the reward of love, 
friendship, and money. Women, especially, often make mistakes and lose money through being carried away by affairs of 
the heart. Under a three final Pinnacle the individual has the 
right to the joys and pleasures of life, but should also make a 
special effort to find usefulness in an inspirational and creative 
manner. """],
5:["""The number five on any Pinnacle represents activity, public life, and the unexpected.
It is never a settled condition, but 
gives an interesting and eventful period of life with freedom to 
come and go, make changes, and to be part of what is going on 
in the world. On the other hand, the five Pinnacle may be a 
period of restlessness, uncertainty, and constant change,
depending upon the type of individual taking a five Pinnacle experience. ""","""Living a first five Pinnacle, a young person is apt to 
be restless, lack in application, and make changes suddenly before the reward of an
effort or work is attained. Much experience is gained, however, which frequently becomes an asset 
later in life, for it gives the ability to meet the public and the 
changing and progressive interest of mankind. The number 
five stands for progress and advancement on any Pinnacle if 
taken in the right spirit; but it is somewhat uncertain regarding 
finances - steady income at one time, uncertain income at another, yet money always comes at the right time and when 
really needed. ""","""It gives opportunity on any Pinnacle for civic interest,
legal pursuits, advertising, and administrative advancement. It does not represent the home or domestic life, since a 
woman may find she is led into some kind of public life from 
desire or necessity. On a second or third Pinnacle it can represent a
period of great freedom, especially if it follows a six or 
four, and can be a very happy, interesting time of life. It requires the ability to adapt to new friends, new lines of work, 
and new contacts. ""","""Quarrels and legal affairs can cause problems and annoyance;
it is important to be sure that all legal undertakings under any five Pinnacle are carefully understood 
and not entered into hastily. For a final Pinnacle it again represents
freedom and an active life. It does not prophesy retirement, however. It calls for an effort to take part in progressive 
undertakings and to help others understand their experiences.""",""" 
Try to keep a few roots down, even though living an active life. 
When sudden changes occur or when restlessness builds up, 
avoid hasty, impulsive actions."""],
